- diagram transpiler - copied das as subdirectory into project
- hw.drawio -> hw.json transpile helloworld diagram
- hwhw.drawio -> hwhw.json transpile re-architected diagram
- wart: das does not transpile simple hello.drawio diagram, -> just use hw.drawio and hand-carve JSON out of it
- diagram parser: das.ohm parses output hw.json and hwhw.json

- next
	- create .fmt for diagram parser and emit same .py code that was written manually
