Hi Ron,

FYI, I would like to share a recent revelation regarding a GIGO that has been hounding me for decades, in case it helps your students:

The center of my swing is the top of my head, not the center of my chest.

Intellectually, I’ve known that I should swing around my spine, but deep-down-inside I want to swing around the vampire spike through my chest (Windmill, Ferris Wheel).  I haven't figured out (yet) how to supplant the incorrect image with the correct one, and, I still have to think about it (which ain't good).

background:

I’m in Toronto.  I heard your interview on GolfSmarter and bought your video.  I’m 67.  I started golfing in 1998 and don’t consider myself to be very athletic.  Johnny Winter’s opening chords to Jumpin’ Jack Flash (Winter And Live) instantly converted me into a wannabe guitarist instead of a wannabe bassist (which was my default, since McCartney has the same first name as me).  I have a ’59 strat (due to Hendrix), a D35 and an 0-16NY (Jethro Tull Thick As A Brick and Aqualung).
