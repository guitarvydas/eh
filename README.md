# Ä— - Goal and Overview

The goal of this project is to program computers using pluggable units of software.

To do this we need:
- micro-concurrency
- 0D
- layers, relative sofware units
- multiple languages.

## Hello World 
Very simple example
## Leaf
![Leaf](./hello%20world%20eh-Leaf.png)

## Container
![Container](hello%20world%20eh-helloworld.png]

## Re-Architecting
![Different%20Routing](hello%20world%20eh-helloworldworld.png)
## Scalability
Pluggability is necessary for scalability, but, more elaborate (complicated) examples would be needed.

# Benefits
- anti-bloatware
- technical drawings come "for free"
- concurrency comes "for free"
- "build and forget" development
- distributed programming comes "for free"
- multiple-CPU paradigm
- ability to plug together software components to create mimimal set of functionality

# Key Insights
- 0D - No Dependencies 
- FIFOs and LIFOs
- Pipelines
- Structured Message Passing
- "First Principles Thinking"
- Closures
